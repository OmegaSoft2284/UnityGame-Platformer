# 🎮 UnityGame-Platformer

**UnityGame-Platformer** is a complete 2D platformer game project built with **Unity** and **C#**.  
This project demonstrates how to design, develop, and structure a side-scrolling platformer from scratch — including player movement, enemies, collectibles, animations, and level design.

Whether you’re a game developer learning Unity or building a base for your own platformer, this project provides a clean, scalable foundation to start from.
